===mission===
[SpaceX CRS-6](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_CRS-6) is the sixth of at least 12 missions to the International Space Station that SpaceX will fly for NASA under the CRS contract.
===cargo===
The [Dragon Spacecraft](http://www.spacex.com/dragon) will be filled with more than 4,300 pounds of supplies and payloads, including critical materials to support about 40 of the more than 250 science and research investigations that will occur during [Expedition 43](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition43/) and [Expedition 44](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition44/)
After five weeks at the space station, the [Dragon Spacecraft](http://www.spacex.com/dragon) will return with over 3,000 pounds of cargo and packaging, including crew supplies, hardware and computer resources, science experiments, space station hardware and trash.   
===science===
Investigate new ways to possibly counteract the microgravity-induced cell damage, including to the most common cells in bones, seen during spaceflight.  Learn more in the [CRS-6 Press Kit](http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/SpaceX_NASA_CRS-6_PressKit.pdf)
Gather new insight that could lead to treatments for osteoporosis and muscle wasting conditions. Learn more in the [CRS-6 Press Kit](http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/SpaceX_NASA_CRS-6_PressKit.pdf)
Continue investigation of vision changes that more than half of American astronauts experience during and after long duration spaceflight. It is hypothesized that the headward fluid shift that occurs during space flight leads to increased pressure in the brain, which may push on the back of the eye, causing it to change shape. The study will measure how much fluid shifts from the lower body to the upper body, in or out of cells and blood vessels, and determine the impact these shifts have on fluid pressure in the head, changes in vision and eye structures.

Test a new material that could one day be used as a synthetic muscle for robotics explorers of the future.  Learn more in the [CRS-6 Press Kit](http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/SpaceX_NASA_CRS-6_PressKit.pdf)
===rocket===
As the first rocket completely developed in the 21st century, [Falcon 9](www.spacex.com/falcon9) was designed from the ground up for maximum reliability, achieving 100% of primary mission objectives on all flights to date.
Falcon 9 topped with Dragon is 207.8 feet (63.3 meters) tall and 12 feet in diameter. Its nine first-stage Merlin engines generate 1.3 million pounds of thrust at sea level, rising to 1.5 million pounds of thrust as Falcon 9 climbs out of the Earth’s atmosphere. Learn more at 
[Falcon 9](www.spacex.com/falcon9) is named for the Millennium Falcon in the “Star Wars” movies. The number 9 refers to the nine Merlin engines that power Falcon 9’s first stage; one Merlin vacuum engine powers the second stage.
===spacecraft===
The [Dragon Spacecraft](http://www.spacex.com/dragon) carries cargo in a pressurized capsule and an unpressurized trunk. It can carry 6,000 kilograms (13,228 pounds), split between pressurized cargo inside the capsule and unpressurized cargo in the trunk, which also houses Dragon’s solar panels.
Although this resupply mission carries only cargo, the [Dragon Spacecraft](http://www.spacex.com/dragon) was designed from the outset to carry crew. Under a $2.6 billion contract with NASA, SpaceX is developing refinements for transporting crew, including seating for up to seven astronauts, the most advanced launch escape system ever developed, a propulsive landing system, environmental controls, and life-support systems. SpaceX expects to fly crew for NASA in 2017.
The [Dragon Spacecraft](http://www.spacex.com/dragon) has the most effective heat shield in the world. Designed with NASA and fabricated by SpaceX, it is made of PICA-X, a high-performance variant on NASA’s original phenolic impregnated carbon ablator (PICA). PICA-X is designed to withstand heat rates from a lunar return mission, which far exceed the requirements for a low-Earth orbit mission.
===organization===
Under the CRS contract, [@SpaceX](http://twitter.com/SpaceX) has restored an American capability to deliver and return significant amounts of cargo, including live plants and animals, to and from the orbiting laboratory. 
[@SpaceX](http://twitter.com/SpaceX) designs, manufactures, and launches the world's most advanced rockets and spacecraft. The company was founded in 2002 by [Elon Musk](http://twitter.com/ElonMusk) to revolutionize space transportation, with the ultimate goal of enabling people to live on other planets.
Currently under development is the [Falcon Heavy](http://spacex.com/falcon9), which will be the world’s most powerful rocket. All the while, [@SpaceX](http://twitter.com/SpaceX) continues to work toward one of its key goals—developing reusable rockets, a feat that will transform space exploration by radically reducing its cost.
===mission_event===
T-3h Three hours before launch, fuelling begins of the Falcon 9 rocket that will carry the Dragon capsule to orbit. The Falcon 9 first stage is capable of carrying up to 385,000kg of RP1 fuel. The second stage holds up to 90,000kg of the same RP1 (refined kerosene) fuel.
T-10m Ten minutes before launch, control of the spacecraft's systems is tranferred to the onboard computers.
T-150s Two and a half minutes before launch, the launch commander gives the final GO/NO-GO decision based on many factors of weather and spacecraft status.
T-0 Liftoff!
T+70s Approximately seventy seconds after liftoff, the Falcon 9 rocket has reached supersonic speed. Just after passing Mach 1, the rocket experiences "Max Q", the point of maximum stress on the vehicle due to the combination of thrust and air resistance.
T+158s Just after two and a half minutes into the flight, the Falcon 9's first stage has exhausted almost all of its fuel and the main engines are turned off...an event known as "Main Engine Cut-Off" or MECO.
T+161 Seconds after the Falcon 9's first stage engines turn off, the entire first stage of the rocket becomes dead weight holding back the rest of the craft. So, this weight is removed by separating the first stage from the second stage by pneumatically adjusting the mechanical fittings that hold the two stages together. This is known as "first stage separation". As part of this mission, the Falcon 9 first stage will attempt to fly to and land softly on a barge positioned in the Atlantic Ocean. If successful, the first stage will be examined for possible reuse in a future mission.
T+169 Just less than three minutes after launch, with the first stage of the rocket out of the way, the second stage's single Merlin engine fires to further propel the craft toward the desired orbit.
T+209 Approximately three and a half minutes after launch, the aerodynamic fairing that covered and protected the coupling mechanics on the nose of the Dragon capsule is jettisoned to reduce weight and begin preparations for eventual docking with the ISS.
T+540 After separating from the second stage and using fins and one engine to orient and position itself correctly, the Falcon 9's first stage will make a landing attempt on the deck of a specially-designed barge named "Just Read the Instructions" positioned in the Atlantic Ocean.
T+577 Nine and a half minutes after launch, the engine on the Falcon 9's second stage is cut off and the craft has almost achieved the desired orbit for Dragon capsule separation.
T+580 A few seonds after the second stage engine shuts down, the Dragon module separates from the Falcon's second stage and the powered ascent of the craft is over. The second stage will fall back into the Earth's atmosphere and burn up on re-entry.
